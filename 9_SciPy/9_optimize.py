Optimization deals with selecting the best option among a number of possible choices
that are feasible or don't violate constraints. Python can be used to optimize parameters
in a model to best fit data, increase profitability of a potential engineering design, or
meet some other type of objective that can be described mathematically with variables and equations.

Mathematical optimization problems may include equality constraints (e.g. =), inequality
constraints (e.g. <, <=, >, >=), objective functions, algebraic equations, differential
equations, continuous variables, discrete or integer variables, etc

example of an optimization problem from a benchmark test set is the Hock Schittkowski problem :

'''=============== Finding the root of a vector function ======================

Finding a root of a set of non-linear equations can be achieved using the root() function.
Several methods are available, amongst which hybr (the default) and lm, respectively use
the hybrid method of Powell and the Levenberg-Marquardt method from the MINPACK.


https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.root.html
'''

import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import root
def func(x):
   return x*2 + 2 * np.cos(x)
sol = root(func, 0.3)
print(sol)




'''=================== Least Squares ==========================================

used to determine a line of best fit by minimizing the sum of squares created by a mathematical function.

LSM is used to Ô¨Åt functions to a set of data.

A cost function is a mathematical formula used to used to chart how production expenses
will change at different output levels. In other words, it estimates the total cost of
production given a specific quantity produced.
